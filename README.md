# TcKNXnetIP_Tunneling_Lib
TwinCAT 3 library implementing KNXnet/IP Tunneling communication over TCP


TwinCAT 3 library implementing KNXnet/IP Tunneling communication over TCP.
The library allows sending and receiving KNX telegrams via a KNXnet/IP interface.

The implementation has been tested with the following device:
- **ABB IPS/S3.1.1 KNXnet/IP Interface (TCP/UDP Connection)**

Other KNXnet/IP devices may work but have not yet been tested.

---

## Features

- KNXnet/IP Tunneling communication
- UDP transport support
- Sending KNX telegrams
- Receiving and decoding KNX telegrams
- Designed as a reusable TwinCAT library
- Structured and extensible architecture (IEC 61131-3, Structured Text)

---

## Limitations

- Currently tested only with **ABB IPS/S3.1.1**
- Other KNXnet/IP interfaces are not officially supported yet
- No guarantee for compatibility with all KNXnet/IP devices
- No ETS integration (raw KNX telegram handling)

---

## Requirements

To use this library, the following requirements must be met:

### TwinCAT Software
- TwinCAT 3 Build Verison 4026.19 or higher
- **TwinCAT TCP/IP license** (must be enabled in the project)
- TwinCAT TCP/IP Communication package installed on the IPC

### Hardware / Network
- Beckhoff IPC or Industrial PC with TwinCAT runtime
- KNXnet/IP interface (tested with ABB IPS/S3.1.1)
- Proper KNX network configuration

---

## Usage Notes

- The TwinCAT TCP/IP license must be activated, otherwise communication will not work.
- Ensure that the TCP/IP communication package is installed on the target system.
- Network ports required by KNXnet/IP must be accessible (firewall configuration).
